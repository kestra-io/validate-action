# Validate Action

Official GitHub Action to create CI/CD pipelines that validate [Flows](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/flows.html)
or [Templates](https://kestra.io/docs/developer-guide/templates/) before deploying to your Kestra server.

This action could be used within a workflow that runs when a `Pull Request` is triggered.

The Action version is based on the Kestra Version. Only Kestra v0.6.1+ is supported.

## What does the action do ?

- Take a folder in input containing your `Flow` **or** `Template` as yaml files. The action look recursively meaning
  resources in subfolder will be validated too.
- For each resource, 2 outputs are possible:
  - ':heavy_check_mark: flow-id' when your resource is validated.
  - ':x: filename' when an error was found in your resource. Following by the error message.

## Usage

### Inputs

| Inputs      | Required           | Default | Description                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `directory` | :heavy_check_mark: |         | Folder containing your resources                                           |
| `resource`  | :heavy_check_mark: |         | Resource you want to update in your namespace, can be `flow` or `template` |
| `server`    | :x:                |         | URL of your Kestra server, if none is provided, validation is done locally |
| `user`      | :x:                |         | User for the basic auth                                                    |
| `password`  | :x:                |         | Password for the basic auth                                                |
| `image_tag` | :x:                |         | Image tag for Kestra image used for validation. defaults to `latest-full`  |

### Server-side validation

The validation can be done locally with the client, but if you have custom plugin or want your `Flows` to be validated
with TaskDefaults included, it may be more interesting to validate your resources on the server-side.

#### Differences between server-side and client-side validation

| Validation         | Server-side        | Client-side        |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Format             | :heave_check_mark: | :heave_check_mark: |
| Plugins properties | :heave_check_mark: | :x:                |
| Customs plugin     | :heave_check_mark: | :x:                |
| Flows TaskDefaults | :heave_check_mark: | :x:                |

### Auth

Depending on your Kestra edition, you may need to include `user` and `password` to authenticate
on the server.

### Example

Example with `Flows`, validated on the `server-side`.

```yaml
- name: flow update namespace action
  uses: actions/kestra-validate-action@develop
  with:
    resource: flow
    directory: ./kestra/flows
    server: https:/kestra.io
```

Example with `Templates`, validated locally with the `Kestra Client`.

```yaml
- name: template update namespace action
  uses: actions/kestra-validate-action@develop
  with:
    resource: template
    directory: ./kestra/templates
```

Example with custom Docker Tag .

```yaml
- name: template update namespace action
  uses: actions/kestra-validate-action@develop
  with:
    resource: template
    directory: ./kestra/templates
    image_tag: 0.13.10-full
```
